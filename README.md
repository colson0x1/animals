# custom useState
- why **useState** uses Array and why not Object?
well because if **useState()** returns an object, then we would have to write out more code to define state variable and state setter
but if **useState()** returns an array, then we don't have to write out so much. we can just write out simple variable name, simple variable name
so that's is the reason why `useState` returns an array!
it just makes easy for developers
